The dashboard provides a comprehensive view of key business metrics, including:
- Total Revenue  
- Units Sold  
- Transactions Number 
- Average Order Value (AOV)
- Year-over-Year (YoY) Growth (2023-2024)

## ✏️ Business Problems

The company has shown strong growth in previous years, but recent data indicate a possible slowdown. However, the reasons for this change remain unclear.

To better understand the situation, several key questions need to be explored:

- Is the recent decline part of a long-term trend or just a temporary change?
- Which products are driving revenue, and are there any shifts in performance?
- Do discounts meaningfully impact customer purchasing behavior?
- How do customer preferences differ across payment methods and sales channels?

Understanding these areas is essential to support better business decisions and sustain growth.

## 🔍 Key Insights

### 📈 Strong Growth, but Recent Slowdown
![instax_sales](images/instax_sales_monthly.png)
Revenue increased by 24.31% YoY (2023–2024), but early 2025 performance (Jan–May) has softened, signaling potential growth risks. Sales are highly seasonal, peaking in January and December and declining mid-year. Revenue also spikes on weekends, particularly Sunday, highlighting an opportunity to maximize promotions during high-traffic periods.

### 🏆 Revenue is Driven by a Few Key Products

Most of the revenue comes from just a few products, especially Instax Mini Evo. This means the business depends heavily on a small number of top products. 

### 💳 Payment Methods Show Balanced Usage

All payment methods generate similar revenue, with no significant dominance. This suggests that customer payment preferences are well distributed across available options.

### 🏷️ Discounts Have Minimal Impact on Purchase Value

The difference in revenue per item between discounted and non-discounted transactions is minimal. This indicates that discounts may not significantly influence customer spending behavior.

### 🛒 Sales Channels Perform Relatively Evenly

Revenue per item across sales channels is fairly consistent, with the website slightly leading. This suggests that no single channel overwhelmingly outperforms others, and performance is relatively balanced.
